# About

Watch Out is a 2D action survival game developed by a team of 5 folks at the University of British Columbia. The game was developed using the ECS (Entity-Component System) architecture aided by OpenGL for the visuals.

The objective of the game is to survive the waves of enemies for as long as you can with bare hands. Learn the attacking patterns of the enemy troops, figure out ways to survive and a strategy to make them take each other out. In-game collectibles and drops are your friends to aid surviving the brutal forces that will chase you to death. 


# Story

You are the lone survivor trapped in the world of Draugamoor, forced to face King Aldric's brutal forces. Obsessed with power and superstition, Aldric forces his troops into his deadly battleground. These are sprawling, open battlefields, surrounded by dense forests, jagged cliffs, and treacherous streams, where the remains of the fallen serve as grim reminders of the ruthless nature of the hunt. Under dark, oppressive skies, the eerie sounds of wildlife are mixed with the distant beat of war drums as enemies close in, determined to take you down. With no weapons at hand, survival relies solely on your agility and wits. The question is "How long can you survive these forces?".
