# Watch Out!

# About

You are the lone survivor trapped in the world of Draugamoor, forced to face King Aldric's brutal forces. Obsessed with power and superstition, Aldric forces his troops into his deadly battleground. These are sprawling, open battlefields, surrounded by dense forests, jagged cliffs, and treacherous streams, where the remains of the fallen serve as grim reminders of the ruthless nature of the hunt. Under dark, oppressive skies, the eerie sounds of wildlife are mixed with the distant beat of war drums as enemies close in, determined to take you down. With no weapons at hand, survival relies solely on your agility and wits. The question is "How long can you survive these forces?".
